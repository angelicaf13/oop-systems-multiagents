# oop-systems-multiagents

The goal of this project was to develop a Java application able to simulate the behavior of different multiagent systems. 
In one hand we had 3 cellular automaton systems: [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), 
the Immigration Game and [Schelling's Segregation Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation). 
On the other hand, we had a system of auto-organized swarms known as [Boids Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).
